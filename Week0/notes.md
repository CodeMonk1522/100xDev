+++++ How Browswer works is that they just render the HTML CSS JS code sent back from the server. Anyone can make a browser as there is a set number of specs to be used.





HTML
As per my observation HTML page is developed in a flow. So Top Nav bar is coded first and then flowing downwards elements are added

1. Tags
    Tags are used to give structure to a website
    <html>, <p>, <a>, <div> are tags
    <div> is short for division and takes the lenght of the page.
    <span> is like a small container of div that takes only as much space as required.



2. Attributes
    Define the things that tag will do

Imp to Remember
Flex is something that is used to place divs next to each other. They start behibg sort of like span.
