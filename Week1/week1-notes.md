1. Why language?
2. Interpreted vs Compiled Language
3. Why JS
4. Strict vs Dynamic Language
5. Single threaded nature of JS.
6. Simple primitives in JS (number, strings, booleans)
6. Complex primitives in JS (arrays, objects)
7. Functions
8. Problem solving
9. Callback Functions, EVent lopp, callback queue, Async
Callback hell and promises


1. Why language
It's used to pass commands to computer. at low level computer only understands 0 and 1 but to ease the work devs use language to write commands and compiler compiles it to 0 and 1 nd computer executes it. 

2. Interpreted vs Compiled Language
Interpreted Language - The language is not compiled before running it it's compiled on the fly and hence program can run partial.
Compiled Language. First the entire code is compiled and then it is run so it there are any issues in code it will be caught before executing.

3. Why JS
learning JS is pretty easy, it has massive applications and huge library and community support.

4. Static vs Dynamic Language
Static Language - Needs declerations and its more strict when coding, cannot change variable types and declarations on the fly.
Dynamic Language - Can be coded fast as the vars can be declared and change teir type on the fly. There's no issue as such when it comes to 
quick coding.

5. Single Threaded nature of JS
JS is notorious for being single threaded which means you cannot split code to run in parts in core. It can be possible in other languages due to OS concept called
context switching. Single threaded nature means code is restricted to single core and runs line by line hence it's not that optimal as compared to other language.

6. Simple primitives in JS (number, strings, booleans)
Ik about this I am well versed with JS syntax.

# Important - Callbacks - The function takes input as another function this is called callback
